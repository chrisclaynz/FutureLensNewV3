# FutureLens Function Security Remediation

## Overview

This package contains tools and scripts to address the `function_search_path_mutable` warnings in the FutureLens application. These warnings indicate a security vulnerability where database functions do not have a fixed search path, potentially allowing search path injection attacks.

## Quick Start

Choose one of the following approaches based on your security requirements and implementation constraints:

### Option A: Minimal Fix (Preserve All Functionality)

```bash
# Analyze the existing functions first
npm run fix:search-path:analyze

# Apply the minimal fix
npm run fix:search-path:minimal
```

### Option B: Enhanced Security with Auditing

```bash
# Analyze the existing functions first
npm run fix:search-path:analyze

# Apply the enhanced fix with auditing
npm run fix:search-path:enhanced
```

### Option C: Maximum Security (Functional Redesign)

This option requires applying a SQL migration through the Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Navigate to the Supabase Dashboard for your project
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `migrations/functional_redesign.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

## Implementation Details

### Option A: Minimal Fix

This fix simply adds a fixed search path to the affected functions without changing their behavior:

- Adds `SET search_path = public` to the function definitions
- Preserves all existing functionality
- No logging or auditing capabilities

### Option B: Enhanced Security with Auditing

This option adds both a fixed search path and comprehensive auditing:

- Creates a `security_audit_log` table for tracking function usage
- Modifies functions to log each call with parameters
- Adds `SET search_path = public` to prevent search path injection
- Preserves all existing functionality

### Option C: Maximum Security (Functional Redesign)

This approach replaces general-purpose functions with purpose-specific ones:

- Creates specialized functions for common operations (e.g., `enable_rls_on_table`)
- Adds comprehensive audit logging
- Deprecates the original `exec_sql` function with warnings
- Provides a migration path to move from general-purpose to specific functions

## Verification

After applying any of the fixes, you can verify that they were applied correctly:

```bash
# Run the analysis script again to check for remaining vulnerabilities
npm run fix:search-path:analyze
```

For Options B and C, you can also check the audit logs in the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Navigate to the Supabase Dashboard for your project
2. Open the Table Editor
3. Select the `security_audit_log` table
4. Verify that function calls are being logged

## Rollback Procedure

If you encounter issues after applying a fix, you can roll back to the previous version:

```bash
# Run the rollback script
npm run fix:search-path:rollback

# Follow the interactive prompts to select a backup to restore
```
